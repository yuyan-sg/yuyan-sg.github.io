          <p class="abstract">
            <strong>abstract:</strong> systematically document governance
            centralization in Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) and
            examine its drivers and economic implications. Using multiple data
            sources and granular onchain transaction data, we find that DAOs
            –including most Decentralized Finance (DeFi) projects – exhibit low
            participation rates and highly concentrated voting power, with the
            top decile of voters controlling 76.2% of total votes. Further
            analysis reveals significant abnormal trading prior to proposal
            creation: blockvoters accumulate tokens to influence outcomes, while
            proposal managers engage in insider trading, earning average
            market-adjusted returns of 9.5%. These conflicts of interest can be
            value-destructive, particularly during crises when effective
            governance is critical to organizational survival. Yet, recent
            innovations such as quadratic voting and delegation mechanisms show
            promise in advancing the goals of decentralization by empowering
            minority token holders and mitigating agency conflicts. Overall, our
            study highlights both the persistence of agency problems in DAOs and
            the potential for well-designed governance mechanisms to improve
            outcomes in these emerging digital organizations.

            <strong>abstract:</strong>This study examines how team reputation
            affects both the funding success and the subsequent innovation
            progress in early-stage crowdfunded projects, with a comparative
            focus on blockchain-based and conventional crowdfunding platforms.
            Using development progress data for blockchain projects on GitHub,
            we find that while teams with stronger reputations raise more funds,
            their subsequent innovation productivity, measured by development
            activity, tends to lag. Further analysis reveals an association
            between higher team reputation and increased turnover of tokens
            post-fundraising, suggesting team members may strategically exercise
            exit options soon after securing financing. In contrast, analysis of
            Kickstarter campaigns reveals a more consistent alignment between
            team reputation, funding success, and project delivery. We attribute
            this contrast to differences in platform governance; Kickstarter's
            structured oversight appears to mitigate early team disengagement
            and enhance project delivery compared to the blockchain context.
            These findings underscore the importance of effective governance
            mechanisms in crowdfunding platforms to ensure that team reputation
            signals translate into sustained innovation outcomes.

            <strong>abstract:</strong>This paper examines how open source
            innovation influences entrepreneurial activity. Using textual
            analysis and machine learning techniques, I classify open source
            software (OSS) released between 2008 and 2020 on GitHub into 226
            software industries defined by Crunchbase. The analysis shows that
            an increase in OSS releases within a market leads to more startup
            entries and greater investment in the following year. The effects
            are particularly pronounced for non-forked, highly-starred,
            organization-created, and permissively licensed repositories, as
            well as for ventures whose founding team members are active on
            GitHub. To establish causality, I exploit inconsistent access to
            GitHub in mainland China and find that startup formation and
            financing decline relative to other countries when access is
            restricted. These findings suggest that open source innovation
            reduces entry costs by expanding access to technological resources,
            generating positive externalities and stimulating entrepreneurship.
